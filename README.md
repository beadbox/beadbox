Beadbox is a native desktop dashboard for the [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issue tracker. It gives you real-time visibility into every task, dependency, and handoff across your AI agent fleet. Changes made in the terminal appear in the GUI within milliseconds.

## Features

- **Multi-workspace** &mdash; switch between beads databases from different projects in one window
- **Inline editing** &mdash; change status, priority, assignee, and descriptions directly in the GUI
- **Filter, search, sort** &mdash; slice your backlog by status, priority, type, or assignee
- **Dependency badges** &mdash; see blocking relationships without running `bd show`
- **Dark and light themes** &mdash; follows your system preference
- **Native desktop app** &mdash; built with Tauri, not Electron. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
